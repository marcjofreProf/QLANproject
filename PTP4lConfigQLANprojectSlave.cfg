# Default Data Set
# The PTP will be more accurate with which ever method of one-step or two-steps that the hardware supports. Seems that BBB supports two step timestamping.
twoStepFlag		1
use_syslog		0
# Run time options
# summary interval is the period between message displays in seconds as 2^N
summary_interval	4
# utc_offset should be 37, but seems that some slaves do not acquire it propperly, so set to zero (so TAI and UTC time will be the same)
utc_offset		37
#
# Port Data Set
# shorter synch intervals help to reduce jitter since hardware clock is more regularly corrected and hence the stability role of the hardware clock is reduced
logSyncInterval		-1

syncReceiptTimeout	3

delay_mechanism		E2E
# delay_filter_length is very important to be sufficiently large to not have too much jitter but small enough so that time corrections in the different slaves happen at the same time - within the time slot of interest

# Required to quickly correct Time Jumps in slave
# step threshold: long values produces large jumps every now and then but allow better precition (less jitter). So it is a trade-off.
# Maybe, for frequency synchronization this value can be low (e.g., 1 us). Instead for Time Synchronization this values should be larger (e.g., 10-20 us)
